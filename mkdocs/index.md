-   [**Stack System.**](stack.md) Stack and Unstack UV Islands automatically and manually. Extremely useful for increasing Texel Density and baking.
-   [**Relax Operator**.](transform.md#relax) This is a new unwrapping method that is well suited for working with organic models.
-   [**Copy/Paste Operators.**](stack.md#copy-paste-system) Copy/Paste parameters (Structure,TD, Position, Size) between Islands/Faces/Maps.
